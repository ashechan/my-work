          Hey! Iâ€™m Ashe. I am a  Web Designer and Web Developer, as well as a Graphic Designer and Artist.  Basically I specialize in bringing your vision to life.</p> 

<p className="about-p">Using my knowledge of web development ( HTML/CSS, React, WordPress, VsCode, and more), I have consulted for start-ups, created and deployed beautiful websites, and provided standard website maintenance. I even placed in an international art contest by using nothing but HTML/CSS to create my piece. </p>

<p className="about-p">With my eye for design and a little help from Adobe Creative Suite and Clip Studio Paint, I have rebranded and helped build brands, created eye-catching logos, business cards, and cover art.
